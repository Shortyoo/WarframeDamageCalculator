- Apply Status Procs and Calcualte with them (i.e. Shotgun: First projectile applies Corrosive Proc -> all other projetiles shall make more damage then)
- Maybe extract a list of weapons by Warframe.fandom? 
- Static DamageTypes-class, so no instance needed for all classes/objects? (memory-efficiency)
- Take Warframe Buffs into account
- Take Arcanas into account
- Make a cool GUI? :D
- Take probability of crits into account rather than averageing it (random-library should be enough here. No need for crypto-stuff)
