- Apply Status Procs and Calcualte with them (i.e. Shotgun: First projectile applies Corrosive Proc -> all other projetiles shall make more damage then)
- Curse an enemy with status procs initially (i.e. you're using a primer. The main weapon shall deal more damage now, though it doesnt apply any proc itself)
- Maybe extract a list of weapons by Warframe.fandom? 
- Take orange- and red crits in account
