- Maybe extract a list of weapons by Warframe.fandom? 
- Static DamageTypes-class, so no instance needed for all classes/objects? (memory-efficiency)
- Take Warframe Buffs into account
- Take Arcanas into account
- Make a cool GUI? :D
- Radial Attack
- DoT procs
- Max status-stacks on bosses (i.e. an Acolyte can take 4 stacks of 1 status at a time, rather than a normal enemy can have 200 slash procs whilst using Hunter Munition)
